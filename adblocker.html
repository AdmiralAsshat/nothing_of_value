    <h1>You Need an Adblocker</h1>

   <p>The reign of pointlessly destructive viruses has passed. Where viruses once ravaged your computer merely because the virus' authors wanted to demonstrate how 'clever' they were, viruses have been replaced by something more profitable:  spyware, adware, and ransomware. As a method of distribution, malware-ridden ads (sometimes called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malvertising">'Malvertising'</a>) spread far more easily than a conventional virus. The viruses of yesteryear required downloading and running that suspicious ".exe" file or opening that curious attachment in your inbox. Malvertising, on the other hand, requires nothing more than a browser and a website running ads from a <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/whatismalvertising/">compromised</a> ad network.</p>

   <p>When the ads aren't delivering malicious content to your PC, they're <a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/web-analytics-visitor-tracking-cookies/">tracking you</a>. They gather data on your browsing habits, which they send back to the advertisers in order to build a <a href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/">'profile'</a> about you. This profile will include <a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/web-analytics-visitor-tracking-cookies/
">whatever they can glean</a>--what kind of computer (or phone/tablet/game console) you use, what sites you like to visit, and then any kind of <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5843969/facebook-is-tracking-your-every-move-on-the-web-heres-how-to-stop-it">demographic details</a> that they might infer from those sites:  your age, race, sex, religion, political leanings, sexual preferences, etc. The average website now reaches out to <a href="https://mondaynote.com/20-home-pages-500-trackers-loaded-media-succumbs-to-monitoring-frenzy-9efeb389cbbd
">dozens of different ad networks</a> as soon as the site is visited. This constant barrage of requests to third-party websites slows down your browsing experience, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/01/business/cost-of-mobile-ads.html?_r=0">sucks up your bandwidth</a>, and <a href="http://lifehacker.com/ad-blockers-on-mobile-can-reduce-battery-drain-by-up-to-1764344384">drains your battery</a>.</p>

   <p>When ads aren't tracking you, they're bugging you. As your page loads, noisy videos interrupt your reading and <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/12/17/facebook-launches-auto-play-video-ads/">begin playing automatically</a>. Intrusive, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/google-launches-full-screen-mobile-ads-in-admob-2014-9">full-screen overlays</a> obstruct the article you're trying to read, beg you to sign-up for their newsletter, and urge you to download their dedicated iPhone/Android 'app' in order to browse a single website; your only respite lies in the purposefully-obscured 'X' button in the bottom-right corner of the window, tastefully placed so as to be out-of-reach on most devices without scrolling. Should you miss the button, we hope you enjoy the sudden redirection to the affiliate's website, thereby displacing you from the page you actually wanted to read.</p>

   <p>Ads are pervasive, invasive, and dangerous. While it has been argued that the influx of ads continue to power the "free and open" web, it comes at the cost of your privacy, your security, and your sanity. An Adblocker can stop these ads from displaying on the webpages and prevent the page from reaching out to third-party websites for the purposes of tracking. In doing so, an adblocker can bring some level of enjoyability back to your browsing experience.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3><p><em>We have had ads in magazines, radio, and television for years. Why are online ads so much worse?</em></p></h3>

    <p>There are a couple of ways that the 'static' advertisements of the past different from today's targetted advertising:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>A magazine ad is typically vetted and approved by the magazine's distributor before printing.</strong> 
        That is, an ad for Coke that appears in Time Magazine was examined and approved by a Times editor. In the online world of ad networks, the website owner usually does not see the actual ad that will be displayed to the visitor (otherwise the ad could not be 'targetted' to the particular vistor). Instead, the website designer allocates a specific placeholder spot reserved for some kind of ad. They then reach out to an ad network, who agrees to fill that spot with an ad from within their network. At the time of visiting the website, when the website is being rendered, the website then reaches out acros the web to the ad network, which algorithmically selects an ad to send back and appear in that placeholder spot. An ad network means that the website owner doesn't have to establish relationships with specific vendors in order to receive revenue, which makes it attractive to them.</li>

        <li><strong>Older ads had no way of knowing whether the ads were actually 'viewed' or not.</strong> 
        That is to say, a company that paid for a commercial to run during an evening primetime television slot might gather from Nielsen ratings that approximately two million people watched the show and hence <strong>probably</strong> saw the ad, but if those people changed the channel or ran to the bathroom during commercials, they would never know for sure. Online ads can track whether the ad was viewed or not by tracking the request made to the image/video where the ad is stored to see if it was actually presented to the visitor. Some websites are so egregious that the page will not even finish loading until the video ad has finished playing.</li>

        <li><strong>Targetted advertising was not nearly as advanced as in modern ads.</strong> 
        In a magazine, radio, or telvision advertisement, the same advertisement was presented to the entire audience. Insofar as advertisements were "targetted", they could only be as specific as the assumed demographic of the consumer:  an ad for a computer would be more likely to appear in Wired than in Salon, for instance. On a website, however, you might see an ad for shoes. When you share the article with your father, however, and it opens in his broswer on his laptop, he might instead see an ad for Viagra. This is all based on what the tracking networks have gleaned about each visitor, based on past visits or based on cookies from other vendors within the ad network.</li>
    </ul>
