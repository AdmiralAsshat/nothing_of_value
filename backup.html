    <p><h1>You Need a Backup</h1></p>

    <p>Your data is valuable. Too valuable to keep all in one place. Unlike physical media, the process of making a copy of your data is not an expensive or laborious process. On the contrary, the mere fact that it exists digitally allows you to make nearly infinite copies at a fraction of the time it would take to physically xerox a document.</p>

    <p>Regrettably, while your digital document could theoretically last forever, the media on which it's stored will not. Your hard-drive will eventually fail, your floppy-disk will refuse to read, even your CD's and DVD's may one day suffer from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_rot">disc rot</a>. If all of your data is stored in one place, it is all but guaranteed that you will one day lose it. The only way to mitigate against this is to make a backup of your data:  that is, store it wherever it is you're currently storing it (your phone, your laptop, your flash drive, etc.), and then store it <strong>somewhere else</strong>. In this way, you have a "redundant" source for your data, should the first one suffer some misfortune.</p>

    <h2>How to Backup Your Data</h2>

    <p>At its most basic, making a backup just means copying your data from wherever it normally resides to somewhere else. It could be as simple as buying a sufficiently large USB flash drive and copying everything important onto it (assuming it is large enough). This would be a quick-and-dirty backup, which would be less than ideal, but it would be better than nothing.</p>

    <p>Each major operating system may have its own built-in tools to assist you in backing up your data. <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5816453/how-to-back-up-your-computer">Guides</a> for backing up on each can easily be found online. At the bare minimum, your backup routine will look like this:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Select the destination media for your backup (a flash drive, an external hard-drive, cloud storage, etc.)</li>
        <li>Select the files or directories you wish to back up</li>
        <li>Copy the selected files to your destination</li>
        <li>Wait, rinse, repeat</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>What Should I Be Backing Up?</h3>

    <p>Everything you care about. Receipts. Tax documents. Schoolwork. Source code. Pictures you've taken. Music you've downloaded. Anything that you would regret losing if your computer were to suddenly turn off and never again turn on.</p>

    <p>If you must limit what you can backup due to space or financial restrictions, prioritize backing up the things that you cannot easily replace. For instance, if your music was all purchased through a digital music vendor like iTunes, Amazon, or Google Play, then losing it, while inconvenient, would not mean that the music is gone forever, as you would be able to re-download it at no charge. On the other hand, if your music is from CD's you ripped yourself, backing up the MP3's would be considerably more valuable, since getting them again would require you manually re-ripping your albums. In the same vein, automatic photo backup is not yet ubiquitous, and so backing up any photos you've taken with your camera or smartphone would be beneficial. The fact that you uploaded some of those pictures to Facebook does not give you a good, quality backup. Since most photo storage sites compress your photos, the ones that you might have uploaded to Facebook will almost certainly be of lower quality than the originals.</p>

    <p>Do not worry so much about backing up the portions of your computer that relate to the operating system (i.e. don't try to back up C:\Windows). In most situations where catastrophe strikes, you are better off reinstalling the OS anyway. OS and registry-related files tend not to transfer well anyway, so backing up the Windows directory from one hard-drive and trying to restore it to a different hard-drive would likely not work.</p>

    <h3>How Many Backups Should I Make?</h3>

    <p>General best practices for backing up follow the <a href="http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/world-backup-day-the-3-2-1-rule/">3-2-1-rule</a>. Simply put, that rule means that for any data you consider important, you should have:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>At least three copies,</li>
        <li>In two different formats,</li>
        <li>with one of those copies off-site.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>What does "in different formats" mean? It means that that keeping all of your data on magnetic hard-drives is a bad idea, because magnetic hard-drives are all prone to failure. Hence, if your data is stored in your primary computer's hard-drive, and your only backups are on another computer or on an external hard-drive, your backup setup fails the second requirement, because they have all been stored on a single format. Ideally, if one of your backups is an external hard-drive, another backup should be a different kind of media, like a CD/DVD/Blu-Ray. A third piece of media could then be something like a USB flash drive (flash-based memory storage and magnetic disk storage are similar, but since flash media tends to be more resistant to falls and movement, this would work in a pinch).</p>

    <p>Why should one of your backups be off-site? This is for what we call "Disaster Recovery". It doesn't matter if your data is backed up across 50 different pieces of media inside your house:  if your house floods, catches fire, or gets hit by a tornado, your data is still gone. Backing it up to an offsite-location provides resistance to your primary location getting wiped out.</p>

    <h3>Manually Backing Stuff Up is Tedious and Time-Consuming. Can I Make it Easier or Automatic?</h3>

    <p>Backing up can easily be automated. I do not recommend automating <strong>all</strong> of your backups, because that would require that all of your backup media be plugged into your computer at all times. If that's the case, whatever wipes out your computer could wipe out your backup as well (e.g. a power surge). Ideally, if you are backing up to an external hard-drive or flash-drive, you should unplug it as soon as you're done and stick it somewhere safe.</p>

    <p>Most operating systems have guides on scheduling backups to automatically happen, once you have configured the files you wish to back up and where you want them to go.

    </ul>

    <h3>What if I Just Store Everything on a Flash-Drive / External Hard-Drive / The Cloud?</h3>

    <p>The temptation to store everything strictly on external media is understandable, given that it inherently avoids the possibility of data loss due to your computer dying. However, it is important to understand that if your documents are stored <strong>only</strong> on an external, or on Google Drive, or on Dropbox, you haven't really <em>backed them up</em>--you've simply moved where the files live.  Keeping all of your documents on Google Drive may make them accessible from all of your devices and store them 'in the cloud', but if you should lose access to your Google Drive, the files would now be gone.</p>

    <p>Additionally, consider the following:  if you have so many songs, movies, or photos that you are storing them all on an external hard-drive because they are too large to fit on your laptop's hard-drive, you should look into getting a <em>second</em> external hard-drive to be a backup / clone of the first. This is, again, to ensure that you never have any files that are stored in just one place.
