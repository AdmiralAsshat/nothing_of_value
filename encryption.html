    <h1>Encrypt Everything That You Reasonably Can</h1>    

    <p>As our devices become more portable, they become easier to steal. Your primary computing device may no longer be a large, unwieldy desktop tower that never leaves your house; more likely, it is a laptop, tablet, or phone. If you use your personal computing device (hereafter simply referred to as "computer") to do anything beyond what you would feel comfortable doing on a public library computer, you probably have some sensitive documents on your computer. Losing your computer to theft is bad enough:  leaving private invoice, medical, or tax documents sitting in plaintext on your computer for the thief to find merely amplifies possible harm done to you. Wherever it can reasonably be done, you should encrypt your devices.</p>
