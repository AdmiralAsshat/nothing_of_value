    <h1>The Bare Minimum of Security</h1>

    <h2>Recommendations, Instructions, and Tools for Keeping You Safe</h2>

    <p>The articles below are designed to provide a basic but by no means exhaustive guide on keeping you and your digital data safe. The recommendations will not provide you against all threats or scenarios. Rather, they are meant to serve as an introduction to security concepts and hopefully establish a baseline of defense for your devices.</p>

    <p>The site was designed with explicitly security-related recommendations in mind, but a handful of practical recommendations have been added as well (I mean, as long as I've got your attention...). </p>
