<h1>You Need to Lock Your Screen</h1>

<p>The information stored inside your devices is valuable. Contacts, emails, browser history, cached logins to Facebook, storefronts, banking sites:  all of these can be accessed and compromised in a pinch by someone who has access to your phone, tablet, or laptop, if you don't bother to lock it. Do not give potential thieves or other malicious actors that opportunity. Make them work for it. Lock your screens.</p>

<h2>Lock Your Computer and Laptop Screens</h2>

<p>When you step away from your laptop for any reason, lock the screen. If you close the lid on your laptop, most should lock the screen automatically, unless you have disabled it</p> for some reason.</p>

<p>If your laptop's lid is always open, or you are connected to an external monitor, manually lock your screen when you step away from your desk. All major operating systems have keyboard shortcuts that can easily do this.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Windows - Windows Key + L</li>
    <li>Mac - Control + Shift + Eject for Macs with External Keyboards, Control + Shift + Power for Macbooks. If your Mac does not have a lockscreen enabled, look <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2011/01/17/lock-screen-mac/">here</a> for instructions on enabling it.</li>
    <li>Linux - Super + L or Ctrl + Shift + L, depending on your desktop environment</li>
    <li>ChromeOS - Ctrl + Shift + L</li>
</ul>

<p>Practice locking your screen until it becomes a habit. No one should be able to examine or modify your computer except you.</p>

<h2>Lock Your Tablets</h2>

<p>While the vast majority of tablets are used for entertainment purposes, the number of people who do shopping on their mobile devices has skyrocketted. If you buy books, music, or even apps through your tablet, your tablet has access to a credit card. Don't leave this device unattended. Ensure that your tablet has a lock screen, and turn it on.</p>

<ul>
    <li>iPad - Assuming your lockscreen is turned on (see <a href="http://www.imore.com/lock-screen">here</a> for instructions on enabling it), the lockscreen should engage automatically whenever the screen turns off. Manually pressing the power button should turn off the screen and immediately engage the screen lock.</li>
    <li>Android - <strong>Settings -> Security -> Power Button Instantly Locks</strong>. This will ensure that the screen is locked as soon as you hit the power button to turn the screen off.</li>
</ul>

<h2>For the Love of God, Lock Your Phones</h2>

<p>The smartphone is an incredibly vulnerable device because we do <strong>so</strong> much on it and we have it with us <strong>all the time</strong>. That makes it a target. A computer or a tablet that rarely leaves your house (or is useless without a wifi connection) can be considered relatively safe from being randomly stolen. Not so with a phone, that might literally be swiped out of your hand as you walk down the street. It is bad enough if a thief should steal your phone:  do not let him also steal your credit cards, Facebook login, or bank information that might be accessible on your phone. Lock your screens.</p>

<ul>
    <li>iPhone - The lockscreen should be enabled by default, but you should take the extra step to protect your lockscreen with a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204060">passcode</a>. <p>If your phone supports it, opt for the six-digit passcode instead of the four-digit one: it is not only two orders of magnetitude harder to guess, but also discourages you from using an easy-to-guess passcode like your birth year or the last four digits of your social security number.</p></li>
    <li>Android - <strong>Settings -> Security -> Screen Lock</strong>. <p>Within this menu you can choose from the possible options:  <strong>Pattern</strong>, <strong>PIN</strong>, or <strong>Password</strong>. With <strong>Pattern</strong>, you will be presented with a grid and asked to draw a shape of your choosing (like, say, a square). With <strong>PIN</strong>, you will create a numeric PIN from 4-17 digits in length. Finally, if you choose <strong>Password</strong>, you will create an alphanumeric (i.e. letters and numbers) password. Of those options, Pattern is the least secure, but quickest to do, while the Password option is the most secure, but takes the longest to enter every time. Should you opt to use a PIN, try to use something longer than four digits, and if possible, make it a nonstandard length. Since the length of the PIN is not communicated at all to the end-user, it will be less obvious to someone trying to break into your phone to try seven digits instead of six, etc (Although I hestitate to recommend a nine-digit PIN, if only because you may be tempted to use your Social Security Number, which could be easily guessed).</p></li>
