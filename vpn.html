    <h1>You Need a VPN</h1>

    <p>The internet is nothing more than a giant transit system of packets being sent between servers. Security was an afterthought:  the original architects were simply thrilled that the packets arrived at all. As a result, most traffic is sent over plain HTTP, which makes it trivial to intercept by packet-sniffing. A simple network analysis tool can be employed to monitor <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2014/06/what-the-nsa-or-anyone-can-learn-about-you-from-internet-traffic/">nearly everything you do online</a>. The information gleaned can be used by anyone:  an eavesdropper at the coffee shop, the NSA, even your <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/03/atts-plan-to-watch-your-web-browsing-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/3/">ISP</a>.</p>

    <p>A safer version of HTTP exists called <strong>HTTPS</strong>, which encrypts the information before being sent to the server. HTTPS will often be employed on pages that handle secure information, such as credit cards or login info. Despite our best efforts, however, HTTPS is not yet available on all websites. One reason is that the enhanced security of HTTPS creates more overhead for the website, as each packet sent requires an authentication 'handshake'. It <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dnaylor/CostOfTheS.pdf">increases</a> the amount of time the page takes to load. Finally, operating an HTTPS website required purchasing a renewable HTTPS certificate from a certificate authority, which drives up the cost of maintaining the website. For a static website which holds no user data or sensitive information, the promise of 'security' simply may not be worth the tradeoff.</p>
